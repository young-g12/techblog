            <p>This blog was created to expand our knowledge of computer science, information technology, 
                and other related tech fields I want this information to reach as many people as possible, with the 
                hope of constructive feedback and back-and-forth discussion of the topics that will be posted. 
                I moved to California earlier this year, a few hours south of the well-known Silicon Valley which 
                resparked an interest and passion I had in programming and coding. Since 2021, I have been developing 
                my skills as a programmer to help transition into software development, and farther down the road, I 
                want to take these skills and disciplines I have been learning and apply them to becoming a bioinformatician. 
                I want to see where the future of programming will take me and see the boundaries, I can push with technology 
                by understanding the minds of computers. With the impact of technology in todayâ€™s age and the need for people 
                who can navigate through the mazes of hardware and software. I believe we are not only a crucial aspect of 
                our modern society but a necessity.
                I hope to gain from this course resources and become more literate when it comes to information technology.
