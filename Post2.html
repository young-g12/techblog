    <h1>Post #3 - Documenting a Day</h1>
    <p>I have created a journal entry, calculated percentages, developed a presentation, and manipulated a database. Each of these has served a function that has broadened my current understanding of software applications.  
        Word has allowed me to edit and create text documents, and spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel have given me visuals which then allowed me to analyze the data by hours and use it to create a pie chart. Using Microsoft PowerPoint has allowed me to make interactive slideshows with visuals and animations for the viewer. Database applications allow you to store and retrieve data.
        Each application comes with advantages and disadvantages. For example, an advantage of all of these is that they are user-friendly and are met to be accessible to every individual. Some disadvantages of Word are it may not be compatible when trying to share between different software or itâ€™s not good when handling larger datasets. A disadvantage of PowerPoint is that people may have an over-reliance on their slides, and it may dilute the main purpose of the information they are trying to convey (Xingeng, 2012). For spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel, if you are not familiar with the arrangement of data or the complexity of functions and formulas then you may have a harder time trying to become advanced in using the spreadsheet application (Incerti, 2019). Lastly, databases can be costly and have a steep learning curve.
        The application software that was most appropriate for documenting information about my day was Microsoft Excel. This is because of the visual representation of my data I was able to create using a pie chart and a data table. It also allowed me to organize my data from the longest to shortest number of hours I spent doing each task. Other scenarios where these applications could also be of use are in technical manuals (Microsoft Word), Financial budgets (Microsoft Excel), and sales pitches (Microsoft PowerPoint).
        Throughout this assignment, I have been able to gain insight into the use of each software application. I have shown the advantages and disadvantages of each application and I have recommended which one was most appropriate for this task. The applications have allowed me to organize and visually represent my data.
