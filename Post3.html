    <h1>Post #5 - Computers in the Workplace </h1>
    <p>Computers have been at the forefront of many great industries in our lifetime. In my current industry of aviation, the evolution of computers has gone hand and hand with the evolution of aviation and aerospace.  Computers are used throughout all aviation in the modern era. Allowing aircraft to become even more advanced than they were decades ago. The first example of computers used in aviation was an electric and pneumatic system that stabilized the plane's course, now known today as autopilot. In WWII computers were used to calculate the trajectory of bombs (Day, 2013). Although primitive and rudimentary at the time it showed a link between computers and aviation that would only continue to grow throughout the years to come as planes and technology became more advanced. Today computers can set a precise course for aircraft to travel, diagnose and aid in the maintenance of aircraft even while flying, and display vital information in the cockpit.

        The sensitive information that can be stored on an aircraft's flight computer, for example, is one reason why I believe is it important for people in this industry to be computer literate and understand the importance of operation security, to not leak any important or sensitive information. 
       
       Considering the trends of computers and aviation's affinity with going really fast, I believe that with engineering we will see more aircraft able to reach faster speeds with the use of more complex computing systems. Also, we will see a rise in the production and manufacturing of more unmanned aircraft. </p>
