    <h1>Post #6 - Network Security</h1>
    <p>Information has become an important commodity in the modern age. Whoever has access to the most valuable information possesses great power. A lot of these big companies and influential individuals need to have secure systems regarding their computers because of the important information that is stored. Hackers are doing everything in their power to access this information so they can make a profit from it or use it with malicious intent. They have a plethora of resources and techniques at their disposal. These things must be taken into consideration when securing your computer networks, web applications, and data.
        Using the ping command or a ping test is a good way to test network connectivity, the round-trip time between two networks, and identify packet loss. Although the ping command offers many benefits for diagnosing and troubleshooting networks certain individuals use this simple command to exploit networks and cause harm to computer systems (Peeva, 2013). The most common type of attack that can be executed using the ping command is an ICMP flood, or ping flood which overwhelms a user’s network by flooding it with packet requests resulting in a DoS. Other types of attacks are ping sweeping and ping spoofing (Net Scout, 2023). 
    These incidents that use the ping command are good examples of types of cyber assaults but there are other kinds of attacks that may lead to a security breach or hack. Two threats that can leave your computer vulnerable are phishing and social engineering. I believe computer systems are vulnerable to these types of threats due to human error. Either by giving what you may have thought was a legit email a password or somebody who may have tricked you over the phone to get your information, whether it be your address, full name, date of birth, and/or social security. Ways to prevent password cracking are to use a password generator which can automatically create a strong, complex password for each individual account (Vahid, 2019) . Two recommendations I have for preventing social engineering are to become educated in ways people might try to gain access to your information. The second recommendation is to verify the person’s identity thoroughly and not just trust in who they say they are. 
    Taking all this into account can prevent your computer systems from becoming the victim of security breaches. It is important that individuals stay vigilant and educate themselves on the techniques hackers are using to gain access to networks and steal information.
