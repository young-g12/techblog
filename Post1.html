    <p>	Scratch is intended to teach beginners the basics of programming. It lets the user input preset strings to show their functionality and outputs. Also, exploring concepts such as variables, if statements, and running the program through the console on the website. It lets people of all levels of programming create.
        My first experience with Scratch was a few months ago actually when I was struggling trying to use JavaScript and needed help in understanding the basics of thinking more like a programmer. At first, I struggled with it and had to watch many tutorials just to understand the basics. After a while I started to see how everything fit together and saw the potential of Scratch. Initially, what I found difficult when using scratch was that it was a new programming language, and I didn’t understand the syntax. I knew what I wanted to create but I didn’t know how to put in place the blocks to make the computer understand what I wanted to create. I overcame the difficulties by using Scratch more and watching tutorials then implementing what I learned from the tutorials. Some insights I gained from the exercise were that programmers think of things differently than most people. The computer is like a newborn baby, and we need to input every piece of data so we can make it walk and talk how we want it to. 
    While reviewing the reading for this week Scratch is different from the languages talked about but there are some similarities. (Vahid, 2019) From the earliest types of programming languages to now they all had the same purpose, so to speak. You would input data then get out more data = output. You used programs to help reduce the tediousness of certain tasks. All the programming languages discussed in the reading all have their strengths and weaknesses in different areas. Python can be used for but is not limited to web development, game development, data visualization and analysis. (Taly, 2008) JavaScript on the other hand performs best at web development whether it be front-end or back-end. It allows for a more interactive user interface. I find JavaScript to be the easiest programming language to use because of the versatility of the syntax and all the helpful extensions that can be utilized. The programming languages that I think are the most popular are Python and JavaScript because of their easy to use, intuitive design and they are widely used throughout numerous tech companies.
