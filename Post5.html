    <h1> Post #4 - Traveling Through a Network</h1>
    <p>Packets travel through the network in a series of hops. The packets go through different network layers and get sent back to the host with the information of its journey from start to finish through the network.  The websites I pinged were from three different countries, the US, Japan, and the UK. They all had the same number of hops regardless of geographical location, with no packets lost, and the time it took for each packet to hop from router to router did not differ much from each website. The behavior of each transmission is consistent. The difference lies in each packet's paths to get to each specific network and router involved. Many factors can influence the roundtrip observed, one being the geographical location of the ping and traceroute.

        You can troubleshoot using a ping test to test for basic connectivity and response times while the traceroute helps determine where a connection problem occurs and network path issues. Two possible reasons why a ping request or traceroute command might time out or return with an error response are either a routing or network issue or a malicious software attack that could disrupt the network connectivity.</p>
